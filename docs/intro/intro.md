# Welcome to IronERP!

:::warning

IronERP is in a very early stages of development. Many features don't work yet and it is absolutely not
production ready yet in any way.

If you'd like to help us get to `v1.0`, feel free to [Contribute Code](https://github.com/IronERP/IronERP/blob/nightly/CONTRIBUTING.md)
or join the <a href="https://ironerpcommunity.slack.com/archives/C07UUQP8LMP" class="slack-channel">Community Slack</a>.

Please excuse the disorganized-ness and/or missing documentation, we're still new to this and we're figuring it out as we
go along :)

IronERP is an open-source ERP engine focused on flexibility and ease of use. Built with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB on the backend, and a Next.js frontend with TypeScript, IronERP provides a practical setup for managing business processes. Itâ€™s designed as an engine rather than just a framework, meaning it comes with a lot of ready-to-use features for small businesses while remaining highly customizable.

A key component of IronERP is its graphical model builder, which lets users define models that form the foundation for entities throughout the system. Alongside this, a flexible CRUD engine dynamically generates views and forms for any database entity without requiring code, making it possible to adapt IronERP to a wide range of workflows with minimal setup.

IronERP is entirely free and open-source, with a commitment to transparency and community collaboration. The project will remain open and accessible to everyone, with future development driven by user feedback and contributions.
