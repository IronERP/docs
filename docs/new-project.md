# Bootstrapping a new Project

IronERP is an extremely customizable system and while it is possible to run it
directly from the mainline source code, the recommended way to deploy it is to
create a customized project based on the IronERP template.

When done correctly, your IronERP backend will always be kept up to date and
any customizations you make won't be lost when updating.
