# Welcome to IronERP!

IronERP is an open-source ERP engine focused on flexibility and ease of use. Built with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB on the backend, and a Next.js frontend with TypeScript, IronERP provides a practical setup for managing business processes. Itâ€™s designed as an engine rather than just a framework, meaning it comes with a lot of ready-to-use features for small businesses while remaining highly customizable.

A key component of IronERP is its graphical model builder, which lets users define models that form the foundation for entities throughout the system. Alongside this, a flexible CRUD engine dynamically generates views and forms for any database entity without requiring code, making it possible to adapt IronERP to a wide range of workflows with minimal setup.

IronERP is entirely free and open-source, with a commitment to transparency and community collaboration. The project will remain open and accessible to everyone, with future development driven by user feedback and contributions.
